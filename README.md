## About

> Iâ€™m Ashley, a frontend developer with seven years at Shopify, mostly with the Shopify Plus Front End Development team, now known as Developer Support. 

I help Plus Merchants optimize their storefronts, implement custom features, and craft discount logic using the Shopify Function extensions or the Script Editor. I also contribute to tools that improve our workflows, including a CLI multitool called the PUB tool, a Rails/React dashboard, and a React Chrome extension.
