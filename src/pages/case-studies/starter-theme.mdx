## Challenge
Each new project started from scratch. Teams copied sections between repos, lost context, and re-solved the same problems. Onboarding took time and quality varied.

## Solution
I designed a **starter theme** with:
- A branching model: `quick-start` (bare theme), `component-library`, and optionally `section-library`.
- Vite code-splitting: `core`, `pages/*`, and **lazy features**.
- A script to add features (`npm run add:[feature]`) that pulls a section and its dependencies from the library into the right places, marked **deferred** by default.
- Clear docs for **CLS prevention**, **accessibility**, and **Figma â†’ code** mapping.

## Impact
- **Speed:** Project bootstrap time dropped dramatically.
- **Consistency:** Shared sections/blocks and docs raised the floor.
- **Performance:** Lightweight core, lazy-loaded features, stable image/aspect-ratio patterns.

## Artifacts
- Repo structure diagram, sample `vite.config` entries, and a short demo of `npm run add:featured-products`.
- Developer guide excerpts (lazy-load pattern, Tailwind safelist, image dimension rules).

## My Role
Architecture, build config, docs, and mentorship across the dev team.
