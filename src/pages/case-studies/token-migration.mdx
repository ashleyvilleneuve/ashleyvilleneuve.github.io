  title="Design Token → Tailwind Migration"
  subtitle="Turning Figma tokens into a scalable, semantic utility system"
>
**Date:** 2025  
**Role:** Lead Frontend / Systems Architecture  
**Impact:** Unified class naming, faster reviews, and easier cross‑brand reuse.

## Challenge
Multiple projects had drifted styles: inline hex colors, ad hoc utilities, and one-off patterns. Designers were shipping consistent tokens in Figma; code didn’t reflect that system reliably.

## Solution
I authored a semantic Tailwind layer mapped directly to Figma tokens and CSS variables (e.g., `text-body-base`, `bg-brand-primary`, `text-text-inverse`, `button-primary`). I also wrote a **migration guide** with quick find/replace patterns and a **priority order** (colors → type → spacing) so teams could refactor without blocking feature delivery.

**Highlights**
- Token categories: brand/surface/text/interactive/typography/spacing.
- Semantic typography helpers (`text-heading-hero`, `text-body-base`) via `@apply`.
- Device + semantic spacing tokens using CSS variables for clamp-based scaling.
- Pre-built button + link recipes to avoid re-inventing component styles.

## Impact
- **Consistency:** Designers and devs spoke the same language; code reviews got faster.
- **Maintainability:** New brand onboarding became straightforward; fewer “mystery styles.”
- **Quality:** Baked-in accessibility defaults and predictable contrast.

## Artifacts
- Token class map and migration doc (excerpted in my internal file `new-tailwind-classes.md`).
- Before/after code excerpts showing inline hex → semantic utilities.
- Optional: screenshots of Figma token panel alongside resulting class names.

## My Role
System design, Tailwind config, docs, developer enablement.
