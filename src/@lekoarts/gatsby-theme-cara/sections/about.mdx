## About

> Iâ€™m Ashley, a Lead Shopify Developer with seven years at Shopify, mostly with the Shopify Plus Front End Development team. 

Now working in the Shopify agency space, I architect and build custom themes, implement custom features and apps, and craft discount logic using the Shopify Function extensions. I also create tools that improve our workflows, including Node.js CLI tools, a Rails/React dashboard, and a React Chrome extension.
